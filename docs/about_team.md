# Welcome Down! 
Welcome to the Core Mechanics, a blaseball team from the Core (wherever that is). There's a lot of stuff around so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

## Back to Basics: What is Blaseball
Blaseball is a free browser based fantasy baseball simulator made by The Game Band. Games are simulated through the the week with the playoffs and finals happening Saturday. Elections happen Sunday and allow fans (like you) to affect the course of the game.

### Ok, but how do you play?
You can sign up at [blaseball.com](https://blaseball.com). All you have to do is pick a team and start watching (go with your instinct, you can always switch teams later). Games usually start Monday with the regular season ending Friday and the finals Saturday. Elections happen Sunday where Fans (like you) can vote to change the course of the game. Blaseball happens in short spurts and if games aren't happening it may be on a siesta where *everyone* sleeps. 

But don't worry, cause while Blaseball might not be happening, the community is. 

### How can I get involved?
Join the [Blaseball Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3uFgJhu) (a.k.a maincord). React to :hammer_and_wrench: in the *#choose-your-team* channel to get access to our team specific channels.

Or... join our auxillary [sidecord](https://discord.gg/Qjvr2wMbsu) for projects, lore jams, and non-blaseball shenanigans.
